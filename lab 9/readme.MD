**Stocks Portfolio Management Application**

Note: The project uses Lombok. 
Please install the Lombok plugin. **In IntelliJ: File->Settings...->Plugins - search 'Lombok'**

## Exercise 1 

Implement a basic stock portfolio tracker application starting from the example provided in package exercise 1.

The aplication should provide following functionalities:
- Authentication (Login) - finish the login implementation. Currently, the credentials are not verified; anyone can access the application.

![market image](./docs/market.png)

- View user portofolio owned stocks
    - View owned stocks in a table view similar to Market;
    - For each owned stock display in table followings: symbol, quantity, price per unit, total price of the position;
    - Also add available funds (cash).

### Implementation notes

Note 1 - Stock symbols are hardcoded in StockMarketQueryService      private String[] symbols = new String[] {"INTC", "BABA", "TSLA", "AIR.PA", "MSFT", "AAPL", etc.}; You can add your own symbol as long as correspond to some real market symbols.

Note 2 - For getting financial market information the application use https://financequotes-api.com/ library:

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.yahoofinance-api</groupId>
            <artifactId>YahooFinanceAPI</artifactId>
            <version>3.15.0</version>
        </dependency>

## Exercise 4 (Optional)

Add a layer of persistence to your application:
- Save the accounts in a file on the disk.
